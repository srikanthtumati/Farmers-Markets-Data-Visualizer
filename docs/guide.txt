1) The main page shows 20 results at a time from the database. Clicking the buttons on the bottom of the page will allow you to see additional results. 

2) The search functionality works if the user gives the maximum distance for the search and then either gives the state AND the city or just the zip code.

3) On the main page (and search page), the market names are links and once clicked, will redirect to another page where all details of the market are displayed. 

4) For values that are not present in the database (some entries did not have zip code etc...), a value of "-1" is used.
